Hi! Im a Second year Graduate student in Artificial Intelligence at the University of Amsterdam. I have a strong research focus on Natural Language Processing and Information Retrieval. Experienced with state-of-the-art machine learning methods, including LLM fine-tuning, LLM-based rewriting, and conversational search. Research experience includes projects in learning to rank, recommendation systems, and robust neural retrieval models. My future interest lies in bridging theory and practice, and tackling new challenges.

## Featured Research Projects

### Practical Identifiability in Unbiased Learning to Rank (JAX, Flax (NNX))
During a research internship with Philipp Hager at the Information Retrieval Lab at the University of Amsterdam (UvA), I independently researched how identifiability can be diagnosed in Two-Tower models using a framework inspired by bioinformatics.  
**Status:** Manuscript in preparation for SIGIR 2026 | [GitHub](https://anonymous.4open.science/r/practical-identifiability-ULTR-E2A7)

### LLM Distillation for Sparse Retrieval in Conversational Search (PyTorch)
Reproduced and Extended DiSCo, a SPLADE-based distillation method for first-stage retrieval, by adding a contrastive loss to improve generalization and performing KL divergence and regularization ablations. Found that stronger regularization improves sparsity without hurting recall and maintains sparse representations over longer conversations.

### Fairness of Vision-Language Models in Healthcare (PyTorch)
Conducted a reproducibility study of a paper introducing a framework for improving group fairness of CLIP. We expanded the original framework to account for multiple types of group fairness simultaneously, enhancing the model’s flexibility.  
**Resources:** [Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06535) | [GitHub](https://github.com/stanfris/FairCLIP_Reproducibility)  

### Domain Adaptation for Low-Resource Biomedical Translation (PyTorch)
Worked on Low-Resource Neural Machine Translation and expanded open directions in Domain Adaptation by adapting LESS, a framework from instruction tuning for data selection, to domain adaptation in translation tasks.
